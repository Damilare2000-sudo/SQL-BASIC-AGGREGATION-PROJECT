# SQL-BASIC-AGGREGATION-PROJECT
With the use of Google Collab and Importing multiple libaries, I have used Postgresql to show profeciency in basic aggregation queries with the COUNT, DISTINCT and SUM functions 
In this project after left joining two tables, and then calculating the unique values of total customers by order date, I also classified them by continent, and then summed up the aggregrate values for each continent
