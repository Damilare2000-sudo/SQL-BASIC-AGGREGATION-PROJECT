# SQL-BASIC-AGGREGATION-PROJECT
With the use of Google Collab and Importing multiple libaries, I have used Postgresql to show profeciency in basic aggregation queries with the COUNT, DISTINCT and SUM functions 
In this project I left joined two tables, and then calculated the net revenue for products of different types while also classifying them as high or low value products
