# SQL-BASIC-AGGREGATION-PROJECT
With the use of Google Collab and Importing multiple libaries, I have used Postgresql to show profeciency in basic aggregation queries with the COUNT, DISTINCT and SUM functions 
In this project I use a LEFT JOIN statement to join two tables, and then calculate the unique values of total customers by order date.  
I write the DISTINCT SUM and COUNT values into individual columns as the continents they hail from and end it with the GROUP BY function with the s.orderdate from the sales table after assigning the alias s to the the sales table
